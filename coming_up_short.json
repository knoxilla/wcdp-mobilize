For seasoned vets, we will get you the literature (if you need it) and list number and you're off to the races! \n\nLet's get out on the doors, get Sue elected, win the Michigan State Senate, and enable a truly progressive agenda to be passed in Lansing next year!",

      "description": "Join us for our next big action as we start door knocking in different locations all around the state! We'll be heading out to the doors to get voters engaged about the upcoming election and making sure this ballot initiative has enough votes to pass in November.\n \nThe United States Supreme Court issued an opinion in Jackson Womenâ€™s Health Organization v. Dobbs and overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nImportant medical decisions should be guided by a patient's health and wellbeing, not by a politician's beliefs. But for too long, politicians across the country have been fighting to restrict reproductive health care, and now they are gaining ground.\n\nIf the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, an abortion ban from 1931 could go back into effect in Michigan, cutting off access to abortion for more than 2 million Michiganders and threatening doctors with prison.\n\nReproductive Freedom for All is a campaign to amend the Michigan Constitution. Our amendment would guarantee the right to reproductive freedom for all, and make sure Lansing politicians cannot interfere in our personal decisions.\n\nSpecifically, our proposal will affirm that every person has the fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which involves the right to make and carry out decisions without political interference about all matters relating to pregnancy, including birth control, abortion, infertility, miscarriage care, prenatal care, and childbirth.\n\nSign up today to help protect reproductive freedom in Michigan.",
