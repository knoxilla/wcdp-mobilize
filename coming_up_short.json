      "description": "Help us make sure Democrats hold the House majority and potentially expand it this November by writing postcard to rally Democrats to vote in 41 competitive House races from California to Maine this November, including three House districts in Michigan: MI-03 (Scholten), MI-07 (Slotkin), MI-08 (Kildee). Our goal is to send 6 million postcards, so we need your help!\n\nYou'll need to provide your own postcards and stamps for this program. We recommend https://progressivepostcards.ourproshop.com, an online store that sells postcards with several of our designs for less than most sellers. \n\nAfter you sign up, we'll email you a list of voters and instructions, which will include an October mailing date and three message options.\n\nClick the \"Take me to the sign up\" button to go to the full sign-up page. \n\nPostcards to Swing States is a project of Progressive Turnout Project. For more information, visit us at turnoutpac.org/postcards or send us an email.",
