Our goal is to send 6 million postcards, so we need your help!\n\nYou'll need to provide your own postcards and stamps for this program. We recommend https://progressivepostcards.ourproshop.com, an online store that sells postcards with several of our designs for less than most sellers. \n\nAfter you sign up, we'll email you a list of voters and instructions, which will include an October mailing date and three message options.\n\nClick the \"Take me to the sign up\" button to go to the full sign-up page. \n\nPostcards to Swing States is a project of Progressive Turnout Project. For more information, visit us at turnoutpac.org/postcards or send us an email.",
