But grave threats to our democracy and our freedoms continue. MAGA Republicans, who refuse to condemn Trumpâ€™s contempt for the Constitution, are using their control of the House of Representatives, the Supreme Court, and state governments to do anything to gain power to achieve their extreme agenda and take away our freedoms.\n\nWe must come together to protect our freedoms.
